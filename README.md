# Clothing Store Website

## Overview
This project is a JavaScript based clothing store website that dynamically renders product listings using structured JSON data. Instead of hardcoding content, the application fetches data and programmatically generates product cards, demonstrating a data driven approach to frontend development.

The project focuses on separating data, logic, and presentation to create a scalable and maintainable interface.

---

## Key Features
- Dynamic product rendering using JavaScript and JSON data
- Data fetched via API style requests and parsed at runtime
- Product cards generated through DOM manipulation
- Clean separation between data source and UI components
- Scalable structure that supports easy addition or modification of products

## Tech Stack
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- JSON  
- Fetch API  

---

## How It Works
1. Product data is stored in a structured JSON format (API based).
2. JavaScript fetches the data asynchronously using the Fetch API.
3. Retrieved data is processed and mapped into UI components.
4. Product cards are dynamically created and injected into the DOM.
5. The UI updates automatically based on the underlying data source.

This approach avoids static HTML duplication and mirrors business frontend workflows where applications consume APIs.

## Why This Project Matters
- Demonstrates practical use of APIs and asynchronous data handling
- Shows understanding of data driven UI development
- Highlights DOM manipulation and frontend logic beyond static pages
- Reflects business patterns used in E-commerce and modern web applications

---

## Deployment
The project is deployed using **GitHub Pages**, allowing it to be accessed directly through a browser without additional backend setup.
